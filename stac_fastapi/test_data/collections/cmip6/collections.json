      "description": "The WCRP Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 6 (CMIP6), is a global climate model intercomparison project, coordinated by PCMDI (Program For Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison) on behalf of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) providing input for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 6th Assessment Report (AR6).The CMIP6 archive is managed via the Earth System Grid Federation, a globally distributed archive, with various portals delivering advanced faceted search capabilities provided from a number of participating organisations. Full details are available from the CMIP6 pages (see linked documentation on this record).CEDA provides access to key CMIP6 simulations including those generated by the UK CMIP6 collaboration between the Met Office and NERC. Replicas of international data sets are provided to aid local access and use.",
